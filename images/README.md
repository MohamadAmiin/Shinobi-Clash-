## Important Notes

⚠️ **Copyright**: Make sure you have the right to use any images you add. Don't use copyrighted Naruto images without permission.

✅ **Fallback**: If no image is found, the game automatically shows a CSS-generated character avatar, so the game will still work without images!

## Testing

After adding images:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Go to the character selection screen
3. Your images should appear in the character cards
4. If an image fails to load, the fallback CSS avatar will show instead
